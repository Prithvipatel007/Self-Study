Linear Algebra is the branch of Mathematics concernded with vectors and matrices, their Linear combinations and operations acting upon them. Linear algebra has a long history in pure mathematics, in part because it provides a compact notation that is really powerful and general enough to be used in geometry, calculus, differential equations, and many other areas of mathematics. But linear algebra in modern times, has emerged as one of the most important branches of mathematics for computing, for statistics, for data science, for computer graphics and all sort of modern scientific numerical and statistical applications. 

So Linear Algebra is really all about vectors and matrixes and how to use them. A vector is an ordered list of numbers which can be arranged in rows as well as columns as well as matrix. Vectors can also represent functions, for example a function of time. A matrix is a spreadsheet. Now in pure mathematics, you can have infinitely long vectors and matrices with infinite number of rows or columns. 

But nowadays, most people are learning linear algebra because they need it for computer science or programming, data science or physical or biological modelling. So therefore, in this course, we are going to be discussing vectors and matrices that have finite number of rows and columns. Now, vectors and matrices have a algebric interpretation - a list of numbers. And vectors and matrices also have geometric interpretation that provide really powerful insights into the mechanisms of linear algebra. 

In this course, we will try to integrate both the algrbraic and geometric concepts to really facilitate learning the core ideas of linear algebra. One of the really great things about linear algebra is that it provides a compact form for expressing ideas in large datasets. That is why linear algebra is so important for big data. For example, imagine that you have a large dataset containing  time series data from 100 sensors and millions of time points. You can represent that large dataset using a matrix. And you can describe all the linear relationships across all possible pairs of 100 sensors over time using this very simple compact expression. 

 $C = X * X^T$

And if you want to determine whether this large dataset can be characterizeed by a small number of important features, you can use a procedure called eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix. Thats expressed using this formula: 

$CW = WL$

This equation is also called a principal component analysis and its one of the key formulas is dimensionality reduction in Statistics. Another important aspect of linear algebra is Combining vectors or features and matrices in different ways to achieve computational goals. For example, you can use vectors to define axes in a high dimensional space and then use a transformation matrix to wrap datasets or objects or other mathematical structures into and out of these spaces. These is really useful because some kinds of analysis are better done in certain spaces. 

Further more, there is often structure embedded in a high dimensional dataset that is difficult to see in the original dataset, but can be easily extracted using a different kind of dimension reduction technique such as eigen decomposition. 

Matrices can be used to encode translations, rotations or stretching or compressing factors. So its really easy to take an image and compres it, expand it, or rotate it along some axis. 

There is a direct link between linear algebra and geometry, and matrices can be interpreted as descriptions of geometric objects like lines or conics. 

The function that defines this surface is called the normalized quadratic form. It is used to extract key features in the matrix in statistics and in data compression. Ofcourse you will learn all about this particular operation later.
